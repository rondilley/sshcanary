=== SSH Canary (sshcanaryd)

by Ron Dilley <ron.dilley@uberadmin.com>

For the latest information on dt, please see:
http://www.uberadmin.com/Projects/sshcanary/

== What is sshcanaryd?

== Why use it?

== Implimentation

== Compatibility

I have built and tested this tool on the following operating systems:

* Linux (openSUSE v42.1 [32/64bit])
* Linux (CentOS v7.0 [32/64bit])
* Linux (Ubuntu v14.04.2/15.10 [64bit])
* openBSD (v5.8 [i386])
* FreeBSD (v10.2 [64bit])
* Mac OS/X (Mavericks/Yosemite)
* Cygwin

== Security Implications

Assume that there are errors in the dt source that would
allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to your
computer.  Don't trust this software and install and use
it at your own risk.

== Bugs

I am not a programmer by any strech of the imagination.  I
have attempted to remove the obvious bugs and other
programmer related errors but please keep in mind the first
sentence.  If you find an issue with code, please send me
an e-mail with details and I will be happy to look into
it.
