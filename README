=== SSH Canary (sshcanaryd)

by Ron Dilley <ron.dilley@uberadmin.com>

For the latest information on dt, please see:

== What is sshcanaryd?

SSH Canary is a ver low interaction honeypot specifically designed to gather
information about potential attackers that attemp to brute-force into a
system using SSH.

== Why use it?

If you are tired of the constant SSH brute-force noise from your IDS and installing fail2ban is just too simple for you, you can use SSH Canary to monitor
attackers and better understand the attributes of their campaigns against your
systems.  It is also nice to know if their dictionaries inculde some of your
passwords at the same time.

== Implimentation

== Compatibility

I have built and tested this tool on the following operating systems:

* Linux (openSUSE v42.1 [32/64bit])
* Linux (CentOS v7.0 [32/64bit])
* Linux (Ubuntu v14.04.2/15.10 [64bit])
* openBSD (v5.8 [i386])
* FreeBSD (v10.2 [64bit])
* Mac OS/X (Mavericks/Yosemite)
* Cygwin

== Security Implications

Assume that there are errors in the dt source that would
allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to your
computer.  Don't trust this software and install and use
it at your own risk.

== Bugs

I am not a programmer by any strech of the imagination.  I
have attempted to remove the obvious bugs and other
programmer related errors but please keep in mind the first
sentence.  If you find an issue with code, please send me
an e-mail with details and I will be happy to look into
it.
