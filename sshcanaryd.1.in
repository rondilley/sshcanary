.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B \flsshcanary\fP is a very low interaction honeypot that mimics an SSH server for the purpose of recording telemetry about SSH attacks.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-c|--chroot \fl{dir}\fP
Run sshcanary in \fl{dir}\fP chroot environment.
.TP
.B \-d|--debug
Enable debug mode, the higher the \fllog\-level\fP, the more verbose the logging.
.TP
.B \-D|--daemon
Run sshcanary as a daemon.
.TP
.B \-h|--help
Display help details.
.TP
.B \-k|--key \fl{filename}\fP
Load ssh server key from \fl{filename}\fP.
.TP
.B \-l|--log \fl{filename}\fP
Write sshcanary events to \fl{filename}\fP.
.TP
.B \-L|--listen \fl{ipaddress}\fP
Make sshcanary listen for connections on \fl{ipaddress}\fP.
.TP
.B \-p|--port \fl{tcpport}\fP
Make sshcanary listen for ssh connectons on \fl{tcpport}\fP.
.TP
.B \-P|--pid \fl{filename}\fP
Write sshcanary PID to \fl{filename}\fP.
.TP
.B \-t|--trap \fl{frequency}\fP
Randomly claim that authentication was successful once every \fl{frequency}\fP connections.
.TP
.B \-u|--user \fl{user}\fP
Run sshcanary as \fl{user}\fP.
.TP
.B \-g|--group \fl{group}\fP
Run sshcanary as \fl{group}\fP.
.TP
.B \-v
Show version information.

.SH INSTALL 

.B You must first generate a server key for sshcanary to present when clients connect.

% ssh-keygen -t rsa -f server.key

If you want to run sshcanary as a non-privileged user or in conjuntion with a real ssh server, you can use iptables to forward connections to sshcanary on an alternate port.

The following forwards all inbound ssh connections destined for TCP/22 to TCP/2222.

# /sbin/iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -p tcp --dport 22 -j REDIRECT --to-port 2222

When you start sshcanary, use -p 2222 or --port 2222 and all inbound ssh connections will be forwarded to your sshcanary.

If you want to allow local connections to a real ssh server from your trusted network (e.g. 192.168.10.0/24) but all other ssh connections to be forwarded to your sshcanary, you can use iptables to forward connections if they don't originate on your trusted network.

# /sbin/iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -p tcp -s ! 192.168.10.0/24 --dport 22 -j REDIRECT --to-port 2222

.SH EXAMPLES

A simple and dangerous way to run sshcanary is on the default ssh port as root.

# sshcanaryd -l /var/sshcanary/server.log -k /var/sshcanary/server.key

A better way to run sshcanary is to set an effective UID/GID using the -u|--user and -g|--group options as shown below.

# sshcanaryd -p 2222 -u sshcanary -g sshcanary -l /var/sshcanary/server.log -k /var/sshcanary/server.key

The installation includes an RC script for Linux that starts sshcanary in the above fashion but also enables random "traps" where sshcanary acts like the authentication was successful as seen below.

# sshcanaryd -p 2222 -u sshcanary -g sshcanary -l /var/sshcanary/server.log -k /var/sshcanary/server.key -t 1000

Logging is done in two places, system related events are logged to syslog and authentication events are logged to the specific log file.

.SH FILES
/var/run/sshcanaryd.pid

.SH EXIT STATUS
.B \flsshcanary\fP returns 0 on normal program termination and 1 on error.  Additional diagnostic information is available through the \-d command line switch.

.SH SIGNALS
.TP
.B \flSIGHUP\fP will cause \flsshcanary\fP to close the current logfile, then start a new logfile.
.TP
.B \flSIGTERM\fP will cause \flsshcanary\fP to shutdown.
